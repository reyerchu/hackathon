_\*these are shown at the end of the signup process_

## Configuration

-   Published: as soon as you finalized your event you can switch to “Yes”
-   Additional important information here: The event needs to be approved by the administration before it's public. It can be set published, but it will be pending until that happens.
-   Project Gallery open: Yes / No - as soon as the projects have been uploaded, switch to “Yes”
-   Projects submitted per challenge: basically “No” - if we want that one team can only submit only one project for a challenge they chose during the event (if we want them to submit many projects then switch to “Yes”)
    Event type: online / offline
-   Does this event have multiple tracks?: depends on event, if “Yes”, you can give the different Tracks
-   Does this event have multiple challenges?: usually “Yes”, as soon as you have the final challenges switch to “Yes” and then you must give basic informations for the challenge (Name - Unique slug - Partner name)
-   Reviewing method:
    Gavel, peer-reviewing: teams can evaluate each other with the help of the Gavel algorithm which gives a weighted average at the end. If the event has no tracks, then all participants evaluate each other. If there are tracks, evaluation is within a track. Basically: teams may review other teams from the same track and from the same challenge!
    Manual review: ...
    Overall winner method
-   Finals, public voting:
    Finals, manual selection: organizers can choose teams who will go to the finals
    Projects → choose the project, click on it → “Does this project go to finals!” check the box

-   No overall winner:
-   Allow vote on own projects: “Yes / No” - usually no, since we don’t want them to vote on their on projects
-   Is finalist voting open: “Yes” / “No” -

## Schedule
