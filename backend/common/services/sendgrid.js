                        that we weren't able to accept you this time. We'd love to be able to accept all
                        of our applicants, but unfortunately that's not usually possible. We received a great number of 
                        high-quality applications, so the final decisions were very difficult to make.

                    <p>
                        One thing to note if you applied as a team: team members had the opportunity to also apply
                        as an individual should their team as a whole not get accepted. So, it is possible that some
                        members of your team have been accepted, but this just means that they we're accepted separately,
                        as individuals.

                    <p>

                Don't worry, it's nothing personal – we want to give out travel 
                grants as evenly as possible to our participants, and thus we divided the travel grant applicants to 
                geographical areas by the country of travel – these are called travel grant classes. We then gave out 
                the travel grants for confirmed participants in order of registration time within that travel grant class. 
                This time there were more people applying for travel grants in your travel grant class than we had budget 
                for and the travel grants were given to those who applied to ${event.name} before you.
