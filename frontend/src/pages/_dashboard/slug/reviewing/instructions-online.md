This event uses a modified version of Gavel to decide the winner. Gavel was created by the HackMIT team in 2015 to solve the problem of deciding the winner of a large-scale competition in a matter of a few hours in as fair of a way as possible. We at Junction have used it at our events since 2016 and have since improved on the original, as we don’t believe outside “experts” are the best people to decide what is a good hack. We want to leave that to the people who know most about hackathons (you, the hackers), and have thus made our own version of the algorithm which allows participants to review each other without being able to skew the results in their favor. If you’re interested in reading in detail about the mathematics and reasoning behind the system, please go ahead and view the original project on GitHub, as well as this excellent blog post written by the creator of the original Gavel, Anish Athalye.

### How it works

Gavel is a fully automated judging system that both tells you where to go and collects your votes. The system is based on the model of pairwise comparison. You’ll start by looking at a single submission and then for every submission after that, you’ll decide whether it’s better or worse than the one you looked at immediately beforehand. If at any point, you can’t pick a particular submission you like over the other, you will be able to skip it and you will be assigned a new project to review. Please don’t skip projects unless necessary. The system makes it simple for you to submit votes, but please think hard before you vote. Once you make a decision, you can’t take it back.
Keep in mind that each member of your team will be assigned their random queue of projects to review, which means that should review projects individually

### Reviewing quota

To ensure quality results, we’ll need a minimum of at least around 15 votes per participant. You will be able to keep track of how many you’ve gone through on Junction App. If your team fails to meet this quota, your score will be adjusted with a small penalty.

### To recap:

- The system will always give you more pairs, and you’re free to keep going until you’ve seen all of the projects.
- There is a (small) quota of project reviews you must make, or your team’s score will suffer a small penalty.
