This event uses a modified version of Gavel to decice the winner. Gavel was originally created by the HackMIT team in 2015 to solve the problem of deciding the winner of a large-scale competition in a matter of a few hours in as fair of a way as possible. We at Junction have used it at our events since 2016 and have since improved on the original, as we don't believe outside "experts" are the best people to decide what is a good hack. We want to leave that to the people who know most about hackathons (you, the hackers), and have thus made our own version of the algorithm which allows participants to review each other without being able to skew the results in their favor. If you're interested in reading in detail about the mathematics and reasoning behind the system, please go ahead and view the [original project on GitHub](https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel), as well as [this excellent blog post](https://www.anishathalye.com/2015/03/07/designing-a-better-judging-system/) written by the creator of the original Gavel, Anish Athalye.

### How it works

Gavel is a fully automated judging system that both tells you which projects to look at and collects your votes. The system is based on the model of pairwise comparison. You'll start off by looking at a single submission and then for every submission after that, you'll decide whether it's better or worse than the one you looked at _immediately beforehand_. If at any point, you're unable to view the demo of a particular submission, you will be able to skip it and you will be assigned a new project to review. _Please don't skip projects unless absolutely necessary_. The system makes it really simple for you to submit votes, but please think hard before you vote. _Once you make a decision, you can't take it back_.

### Reviewing quota

To ensure quality results, each participant should review at least 5 other projects. However, since reviewing other projects is a lot of fun, you're free to keep going until you've reviewed all of the other projects. If your team does not participate in reviewing other projects, we reserve the right to apply a small penalty to your team's score.

### To recap:

-   The system will always tell you which project to go look at next, and you're free to keep going
    until you've seen all of the projects.
-   You will always compare your current project to the one you saw immediately beforehand,
    regardless of who won the previous comparison.
-   There is a (small) quota of project reviews your team must make (all team members combined), or
    your team's score will be applied a small penalty.
